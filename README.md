Built with Angular and Electron.

## Setup

First, enter the time of the countdown, and press "Start". After that, the countdown will start and
the battery will be enabled to fill with points.

Note: if you start the countdown with the "Lock" label checked, all controls will be disabled except for the UP arrow key to fill the battery.

## Controls

* C: enable/disable the countdown
* B: enable/disable the battery container
* UP & DOWN arrow keys: control level of the battery
* LEFT & RIGHT arrow keys: control the time of the countdown in case it has to be changed
